<p>Application promotion means moving an application through various runtime
environments, typically with an increasing level of maturity. For example, an
application might start out in a development environment, then be promoted to a
stage environment for further testing, before finally being promoted into a
production environment. As changes are introduced in the application, again the
changes will start in development and be promoted through stage and production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "application" today is more than just the source code written in Java, Perl,
Python, etc. It is more now than the static web content, the integration
scripts, or the associated configuration for the language specific runtimes for
the application. It is more than the application specific archives consumed by
those language specific runtimes.</p>

<h3 id="dev-guide-promoting-applications-api-objects"><a class="anchor" href="#dev-guide-promoting-applications-api-objects"></a>API Objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With regard to OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes resource definitions (the items
newly introduced to the application inventory), there are a couple of key design
points for these API objects that are relevant to revisit when considering the
topic of application promotion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, as highlighted throughout OpenShift Container Platform documentation, every API object
can be expressed via either JSON or YAML, making it easy to manage these
resource definitions via traditional source control and scripting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the API objects are designed such that there are portions of the object
which specify the desired state of the system, and other portions which reflect
the status or current state of the system. This can be thought of as inputs and
outputs. The input portions, when expressed in JSON or YAML, in particular are
items that fit naturally as source control managed (SCM) artifacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-note" title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember, the input or specification portions of the API objects can be totally
static or dynamic in the sense that
<a href="../templates.html#writing-parameters">variable substitution via template
processing</a> is possible on instantiation.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of these points with respect to API objects is that with their
expression as JSON or YAML files, you can treat the configuration of the
application  as code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conceivably, almost any of the API objects may be considered an application
artifact by your organization. Listed below are the objects most commonly
associated with deploying and managing an application:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">BuildConfigs</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a special case resource in the context of application
promotion. While a <code>BuildConfig</code> is certainly a part of the application,
especially from a developer&#8217;s perspective, typically the <code>BuildConfig</code> is not
promoted through the pipeline. It produces the <code>Image</code> that is promoted (along
with other items) through the pipeline.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Templates</dt>
<dd>
<p>In terms of application promotion, <code>Templates</code> can serve as the
starting point for setting up resources in a given staging environment,
especially with the parameterization capabilities. Additional post-instantiation
modifications are very conceivable though when applications move through a
promotion pipeline. See
<a href="#dev-guide-promoting-applications-scenarios">Scenarios and Examples</a> for more
on this.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Routes</dt>
<dd>
<p>These are the most typical resources that differ stage to stage in the
application promotion pipeline, as tests against different stages of an
application access that application via its <code>Route</code>. Also, remember that you have
options with regard to manual specification or auto-generation of host names, as
well as the HTTP-level security of the <code>Route</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Services</dt>
<dd>
<p>If reasons exist to avoid <code>Routers</code> and <code>Routes</code> at given application
promotion stages (perhaps for simplicity&#8217;s sake for individual developers at
early stages), an application can be accessed via the <code>Cluster</code> IP address and
port. If used, some management of the address and port between stages could be
warranted.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Endpoints</dt>
<dd>
<p>Certain application-level services (e.g., database instances in many
enterprises) may not be managed by OpenShift Container Platform. If so, then creating those
<code>Endpoints</code> yourself, along with the necessary modifications to the associated
<code>Service</code> (omitting the selector field on the <code>Service</code>) are activities that are
either duplicated or shared between stages (based on how you delineate your
environment).</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Secrets</dt>
<dd>
<p>The sensitive information encapsulated by <code>Secrets</code> are shared between
staging environments when the corresponding entity (either a <code>Service</code> managed
by OpenShift Container Platform or an external service managed outside of OpenShift Container Platform)
the information pertains to is shared. If there are different versions of the
said entity in different stages of your application promotion pipeline, it may
be necessary to maintain a distinct <code>Secret</code> in each stage of the pipeline or to
make modifications to it as it traverses through the pipeline. Also, take care
that if you are storing the <code>Secret</code> as JSON or YAML in an SCM, some form of
encryption to protect the sensitive information may be warranted.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DeploymentConfigs</dt>
<dd>
<p>This object is the primary resource for defining and scoping
the environment for a given application promotion pipeline stage; it controls
how your application starts up. While there are aspects of it that will be
common across all the different stage, undoubtedly there will be modifications
to this object as it progresses through your application promotion pipeline to
reflect differences in the environments for each stage, or changes in behavior
of the system to facilitate testing of the different scenarios your application
must support.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ImageStreams, ImageStreamTags, and ImageStreamImage</dt>
<dd>
<p>Detailed in the
<a href="#dev-guide-promoting-application-images">Images</a> and
<a href="../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams">Image
Streams</a> sections, these objects are central to the OpenShift Container Platform additions
around managing container images.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ServiceAccounts and RoleBindings</dt>
<dd>
<p>Management of permissions to other API
objects within OpenShift Container Platform, as well as the external services, are intrinsic
to managing your application. Similar to <code>Secrets</code>, the <code>ServiceAccounts</code> and
<code>RoleBindings</code> objects can vary in how they are shared between the different
stages of your application promotion pipeline based on your needs to share or
isolate those different environments.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">PersistentVolumeClaims</dt>
<dd>
<p>Relevant to stateful services like databases, how much
these are shared between your different application promotion stages directly
correlates to how your organization shares or isolates the copies of your
application data.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">ConfigMaps</dt>
<dd>
<p>A useful decoupling of <code>Pod</code> configuration from the <code>Pod</code> itself
(think of an environment variable style configuration), these can either be
shared by the various staging environments when consistent <code>Pod</code> behavior is
desired. They can also be modified between stages to alter <code>Pod</code> behavior
(usually as different aspects of the application are vetted at different
stages).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="dev-guide-promoting-application-images"><a class="anchor" href="#dev-guide-promoting-application-images"></a>Images</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted earlier, container images are now artifacts of your application. In
fact, of the new applications artifacts, images and the management of images are
the key pieces with respect to application promotion. In some cases, an image
might encapsulate the entirety of your application, and the application
promotion flow consists solely of managing the image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Images are not typically managed in a SCM system, just as application binaries
were not in previous systems. However, just as with binaries, installable
artifacts and corresponding repositories (such as RPMs, RPM repositories, or Nexus)
arose with similar semantics to SCMs. Therefore, constructs and terminology
around image management that are similar to SCMs have emerged:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Image registry == SCM server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Image repository == SCM repository</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As images reside in registries, application promotion is concerned with ensuring
the appropriate image exists in a registry that can be accessed from the
environment that needs to run the application represented by that image.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than reference images directly, application definitions typically
abstract the reference into an image stream. This means the image stream will be
another API object that makes up the application components. For more details on
image streams, see
<a href="../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams">Core
Concepts</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that the application artifacts of note, images and API objects, have been
detailed in the context of application promotion within OpenShift Container Platform, the
notion of <em>where</em> you run your application in the various stages of your
promotion pipeline is next the point of discussion.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A deployment environment, in this context, describes a distinct space for an
application to run during a particular stage of a CI/CD pipeline. Typical
environments include <strong>development</strong>, <strong>test</strong>, <strong>stage</strong>, and <strong>production</strong>, for
example. The boundaries of an environment can be defined in different ways, such
as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Via labels and unique naming within a single project.</p>

<h3 id="dev-guide-promoting-application-de-considerations"><a class="anchor" href="#dev-guide-promoting-application-de-considerations"></a>Considerations</h3>

<p>Typically, you will consider the following heuristics in how you structure the
deployment environments:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>How much resource sharing the various stages of your promotion flow allow</p>

<li>
<p>How centrally located (or geographically dispersed) the various stages of your promotion flow are</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, some important reminders on how OpenShift Container Platform clusters and projects
relate to image registries:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multiple project in the same cluster can access the same image streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple clusters can access the same external registries.</p>

<p>There are a number of insertion points available during both the build and
deployment processes. They are defined within <code>BuildConfig</code> and
<code>DeploymentConfig</code> API objects. These hooks allow for the invocation of custom
scripts which can interact with deployed components such as databases, and with
the OpenShift Container Platform cluster itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, it is possible to use these hooks to perform component management
operations that effectively move applications between environments, for example
by performing an image tag operation from within a hook. However, the various
hook points are best suited to managing an application&#8217;s lifecycle within a
given environment (for example, using them to perform database schema migrations
when a new version of the application is deployed), rather than to move
application components between environments.</p>

<p>Resources, as defined in one environment, will be exported as JSON or YAML file

<p>API object specifications should be captured with <code>oc get --export</code>. This operation
removes environment specific data from the object definitions (e.g., current

the object).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use of <code>oc label</code>, which allows for adding, modifying, or removing labels on API
objects, can prove useful as you organize the set of object collected for
promotion flows, because labels allow for selection and management of groups of
pods in a single operation. This makes it easier to export the correct set of
objects and, because the labels will carry forward when the objects are created
in a new environment, they also make for easier management of the application
components in each environment.</p>

<p>First, analogous to <code>docker tag</code> and <code>git tag</code>, the <code>oc tag</code> command allows you
to update an OpenShift Container Platform image stream with a reference to a specific image.
It also allows you to copy references to specific versions of an image from one
image stream to another, even across different projects in a cluster.</p>

<p>Second, the <code>oc import-image</code> serves as a bridge between external registries and

stores it into the image stream as an

configure the application, a deployment is typically necessary to pick up the

an <code>oc tag</code> operation or a <code>docker push</code> as part of promoting an image from an
upstream environment), <code>ImageChangeTriggers</code> on your <code>DeploymentConfig</code> can
trigger the new deployment. Similarly, if the <code>DeploymentConfig</code> API object
itself is being changed, a <code>ConfigChangeTrigger</code> can initiate a deployment when
the API object is updated by the promotion step (for example, <code>oc apply</code>).</p>

<p>After you understand the components of your application that need to be moved
between environments when promoting it and the steps required to move the
components, you can start to orchestrate and automate the workflow.
OpenShift Container Platform provides a Jenkins image and plug-ins to help with this process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OpenShift Container Platform Jenkins image is detailed in
<a href="../../using_images/other_images/jenkins.html#using-images-other-images-jenkins">Using

<div class="paragraph">
<p>API objects can reference other objects. A common use for this is to have a
<code>DeploymentConfig</code> that references an image stream, but other reference
relationships may also exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When copying an API object from one environment to another, it is critical that
all references can still be resolved in the target environment. There are a few
reference scenarios to consider:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reference is "local" to the project. In this case, the referenced object
resides in the same project as the object that references it. Typically the
correct thing to do is to ensure that you copy the referenced object into the
target environment in the same project as the object referencing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reference is to an object in another project. This is typical when an image
stream in a shared project is used by multiple application projects. In this case, when copying the referencing object to the new
environment, you must update the reference as needed so it can be resolved in
the target environment. That may mean:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changing the project the reference points to, if the shared project has a
different name in the target environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moving the referenced object from the shared project into the local project in
the target environment and updating the reference to point to the local project
when moving the primary object into the target environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some other combination of copying the referenced object into the target
environment and updating references to it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the guidance is to consider objects referenced by the objects being
copied to a new environment and ensure the references are resolvable in the
target environment. If not, take appropriate action to fix the references and
make the referenced objects available in the target environment.</p>

it is important to consider whether the registry and repository reference should
also change:</p>

<p>Having defined the new application artifact components introduced by the Docker,

promote those components between environments using the mechanisms and
tools provided by OpenShift Container Platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of the components making up an application, the image is the primary artifact of
note. Taking that premise and extending it to application promotion, the core,
fundamental application promotion pattern is image promotion, where the unit of
work is the image. The vast majority of application promotion scenarios entails
management and propagation of the image through the promotion pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simpler scenarios solely deal with managing and propagating the image through
the pipeline. As the promotion scenarios broaden in scope, the other application
artifacts, most notably the API objects, are included in the inventory of items
managed and propagated through the pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This topic lays out some specific examples around promoting images as well as
API objects, using both manual and automated approaches. But first, note the
following on setting up the environment(s) for your application promotion

<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you have completed development of the initial revision of your
application, the next logical step is to package up the contents of the
application so that you can transfer to the subsequent staging environments of
your promotion pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>First, group all the API objects you view as transferable and apply a common
<code>label</code> to them:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap">labels:
  promotion-group: &lt;application_name&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

labels with your various API objects.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You can leverage that label on subsequent queries. For example, consider the

<p>After the initial setup of the different staging environments for your pipeline,
a set of repeatable steps to validate each iteration of your application through

<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Typically, the first step is promoting any updates to the image(s) associated
with your application to the next stage in the pipeline. As noted above, the key
differentiator in promoting images is whether the OpenShift Container Platform registry is
shared or not between staging environments.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">

<p>Next, there are the cases where the evolution of your application necessitates
fundamental changes to your API objects or additions and deletions from the set
of API objects that make up the application. When such evolution in your
application&#8217;s API objects occurs, the OpenShift Container Platform CLI provides a broad range
of options to transfer to changes from one staging environment to the next.</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Start in the same fashion as you did when you initially set up your promotion

<li>
<p>Rather than simply creating the resources in the new environment, update them. You can do this a few different ways:</p>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>The more conservative approach is to leverage <code>oc apply</code> and merge the new
changes to each API object in the target environment. In doing so, you can
<code>--dry-run=true</code> option and examine the resulting objects prior to actually
changing the objects:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap">$ oc apply -f export.yaml --dry-run=true</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<p>The <code>apply</code> command optionally takes additional arguments that help with more
complicated scenarios. See <code>oc apply --help</code> for more details.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternatively, the simpler but more aggressive approach is to leverage <code>oc
replace</code>. There is no dry run with this update and replace. In the most basic
form, this involves executing:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap">$ oc replace -f export.yaml</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with <code>apply</code>, <code>replace</code> optionally takes additional arguments for more

</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The previous steps automatically handle new API objects that were introduced,
but if API objects were deleted from the source environment, they must be
manually deleted from the target environment using <code>oc delete</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tuning of the environment variables cited on any of the API objects may be
necessary as the desired values for those may differ between staging
environments. For this, use <code>oc set env</code>:</p>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap">$ oc set env &lt;api_object_type&gt;/&lt;api_object_ID&gt; &lt;env_var_name&gt;=&lt;env_var_value&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, trigger a new deployment of the updated application using the <code>oc
