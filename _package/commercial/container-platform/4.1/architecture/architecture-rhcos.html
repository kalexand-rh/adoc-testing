<h2 id="rhcos-about_architecture-rhcos"><a class="anchor" href="#rhcos-about_architecture-rhcos"></a>About RHCOS</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) represents the next generation of single-purpose
container operating system technology. Created by the same development teams
that created Red Hat Enterprise Linux Atomic Host and CoreOS Container Linux,
RHCOS combines the quality standards of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
with the automated, remote upgrade features from Container Linux.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHCOS is supported only as a component of OpenShift Container Platform
4.1 for all OpenShift Container Platform machines. RHCOS is the only
supported operating system for OpenShift Container Platform control plane, or master,
machines. While RHCOS is the default operating system for all cluster
machines, you can create compute, or worker, machines that use RHEL as their
operating system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you install your cluster on infrastructure that the cluster provisions,
RHCOS images are downloaded to the target platform during installation,
and suitable Ignition config files, which control the RHCOS configuration,
are used to deploy the machines. If you install your cluster on infrastructure
that you manage, you must follow the installation documentation to obtain the
RHCOS images, generate Ignition config files, and use the Ignition config
files to provision your machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rhcos-key-features_architecture-rhcos"><a class="anchor" href="#rhcos-key-features_architecture-rhcos"></a>Key RHCOS features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following list describes key features of the RHCOS operating system:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The underlying operating system consists primarily of RHEL components.
The same quality, security, and control measures that support RHEL also support
RHCOS. For example, RHCOS software is in
RPM packages, and each RHCOS system starts up with a RHEL kernel and a set
of services that are managed by the systemd init system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although it contains RHEL components, RHCOS is designed to be managed
more tightly than a default RHEL installation. Management is
performed remotely from the OpenShift Container Platform cluster. When you set up your
RHCOS machines, you can modify only a few system settings. This controlled
immutability allows OpenShift Container Platform to
store the latest state of RHCOS systems in the cluster so it is always
able to create additional machines and perform updates based on the latest RHCOS
configurations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although RHCOS contains features for running the
OCI- and libcontainer-formatted containers that Docker requires, it incorporates
the CRI-O container engine
instead of the Docker container engine. By focusing on features needed by
Kubernetes platforms, such as OpenShift Container Platform, CRI-O can offer specific
compatibility with different Kubernetes versions. CRI-O also offers a smaller
footprint and reduced attack surface than is possible with container engines
that offer a larger feature set. At the moment, CRI-O is only available as a
container engine within OpenShift Container Platform clusters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For tasks such as building, copying, and otherwise
managing containers, RHCOS replaces the Docker CLI tool with a compatible
set of container tools. The podman CLI tool supports many container runtime
features, such as running, starting, stopping, listing, and removing containers
and container images. The skopeo CLI tool can copy, authenticate, and sign
images. You can use the crictl CLI tool to work with containers and pods from the
CRI-O container engine. While direct use of these tools in RHCOS is
discouraged, you can use them for debugging purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RHCOS features transactional upgrades using the <code>rpm-ostree</code> system.
 Updates are delivered via container images and are part of the
 OpenShift update process. When deployed, the container image is pulled,
 extracted, and written to disk, then the bootloader is modified to boot into
 the new version. The machine will reboot into the update in a rolling manner to
 ensure cluster capacity is minimally impacted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For RHCOS systems, the layout of the <code>rpm-ostree</code> file system has the
 following characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/usr</code> is where the operating system binaries and libraries are stored and is
read-only. We do not support altering this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/etc</code>, <code>/boot</code>, <code>/var</code> are writable on the system but only intended to be altered
by the Machine Config Operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/var/lib/containers</code> is the graph storage location for storing container
images.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In OpenShift Container Platform, the Machine Config Operator handles operating system upgrades.
Instead of upgrading individual packages, as is done with <code>yum</code>
upgrades, <code>rpm-ostree</code> delivers upgrades of the OS as an atomic unit. The
new OS deployment is staged during upgrades and goes into effect on the next reboot.
If something goes wrong with the upgrade, a single rollback and reboot returns the
system to the previous state. RHCOS upgrades in OpenShift Container Platform are performed
during cluster updates.</p>

<h3 id="rhcos-configuring_architecture-rhcos"><a class="anchor" href="#rhcos-configuring_architecture-rhcos"></a>Configuring RHCOS in OpenShift Container Platform</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For OpenShift Container Platform, RHCOS images are set up initially with a feature called
<code>Ignition</code>, which runs only on the system’s
first boot. After first boot, RHCOS systems are managed by the
Machine Config Operator (MCO) that runs in the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because RHCOS systems in OpenShift Container Platform are designed to be fully managed
from the OpenShift Container Platform cluster, directly logging in to a RHCOS machine is
discouraged. Limited direct access to RHCOS machines in an OpenShift Container Platform
cluster can be completed for debugging purposes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="rhcos-about-ignition_architecture-rhcos"><a class="anchor" href="#rhcos-about-ignition_architecture-rhcos"></a>About Ignition</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ignition is the utility that is used by RHCOS to manipulate disks during
initial configuration. It completes common disk tasks, including partitioning
disks, formatting partitions, writing files, and configuring users. On first
boot, Ignition reads its configuration from the installation media or the
location that you specify and applies the configuration to the machines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether you are installing your cluster or adding machines to it, Ignition
always performs the initial configuration of the OpenShift Container Platform
cluster machines. Most of the actual system setup happens on each machine
itself. For each machine,
Ignition takes the RHCOS image and boots the RHCOS kernel. Options
on the kernel command line, identify the type of deployment and the location of
the Ignition-enabled initial Ram Disk (initramfs).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenShift Container Platform uses Ignition version 2 and Ignition config version 2.3</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="about-ignition_architecture-rhcos"><a class="anchor" href="#about-ignition_architecture-rhcos"></a>How Ignition works</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create machines by using Ignition, you need Ignition config files. The
OpenShift Container Platform installation program creates the Ignition config files that you
need to deploy your cluster. These files are based on the information that you
provide to the installation program directly or through an <code>install-config.yaml</code>
file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The way that Ignition configures machines is similar to how tools like
<a href="https://cloud-init.io/">cloud-init</a> or Linux Anaconda
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/installation_guide/index#chap-kickstart-installations">kickstart</a>
configure systems, but with some important differences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ignition runs from an initial RAM disk that is separate
from the system you are installing to. Because of that, Ignition can
repartition disks, set up file systems, and perform other changes to the
machine’s permanent file system. In contrast, cloud-init runs as part of a
machine’s init system when
the system boots, so making foundational changes to things like disk partitions
cannot be done as easily. With cloud-init, it is also difficult to reconfigure
the boot process while you are in the middle of the node&#8217;s boot process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition is meant to initialize systems, not change existing systems. After a
machine initializes and the kernel is running from the installed system, the
Machine Config Operator from the OpenShift Container Platform cluster completes all future
machine configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of completing a defined set of actions, Ignition implements
a declarative configuration. It checks that all partitions, files, services,
and other items are in place before the new machine starts. It then makes the
changes, like copying files to disk that are necessary for the new machine to
meet the specified configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Ignition finishes configuring a machine, the kernel keeps running but
discards the initial RAM disk and pivots to the installed system on disk. All of
the new system services and other features start without requiring a system
reboot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Ignition confirms that all new machines meet the declared configuration,
you cannot have a partially-configured machine. If a machine’s setup fails,
the initialization process does not finish, and Ignition does not start the new
machine. Your cluster will never contain partially-configured machines. If
Ignition cannot complete, the machine is not added to the cluster. You must add
a new machine instead. This behavior prevents the difficult case of debugging a machine when the results of a
failed configuration task are not known until something that depended on it
fails at a later date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a problem with an
Ignition config that causes the setup of a machine to fail, Ignition will not try
to use the same config to set up another machine. For example, a failure could
result from an Ignition config made up of a parent and child config that both
want to create the same file. A failure in such a case would prevent that
Ignition config from being used again to set up an other machines, until the
problem is resolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have multiple Ignition config files, you get a union of that set of
configs.  Because Ignition is declarative, conflicts between the configs could
cause Ignition to fail to set up the machine. The order of information in those
files doesn’t matter. Ignition will sort and implement each setting in ways that
 make the most sense. For example, if a file needs a directory several levels
 deep, if another file needs a directory along that path, the later file is
 created first. Ignition sorts and creates all files, directories, and
 links by depth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Ignition can start with a completely empty hard disk, it can do
something cloud-init can’t do: set up systems on bare metal from scratch
(using features such as PXE boot). In the bare metal case, the Ignition config
is injected into the boot partition so Ignition can find it and configure
the system correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="ignition-sequence_architecture-rhcos"><a class="anchor" href="#ignition-sequence_architecture-rhcos"></a>The Ignition sequence</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Ignition process for an RHCOS machine in an OpenShift Container Platform cluster
involves the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The machine gets its Ignition config file. Master machines get their Ignition
config files from the bootstrap machine, and worker machines get Ignition config
files from a master.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition creates disk partitions, file systems, directories, and links on the
machine. It supports RAID arrays but does not support LVM volumes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition mounts the root of the permanent file system to the <code>/sysroot</code>
directory in the
initramfs and starts working in that <code>/sysroot</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition configures all defined file systems and sets them up to mount appropriately
at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition runs <code>systemd</code> temporary files to populate required files in the
<code>/var</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition runs the Ignition config files to set up users, systemd unit files,
and other configuration files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition unmounts all components in the permanent system that were mounted in
the initramfs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignition starts up new machine’s init process which, in turn, starts up all other
services on the machine that run during system boot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine is then ready to join the cluster and does not require a reboot.</p>

<p>Here are a few things you can learn from the <code>bootstrap.ign</code> file:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Format: The format of the file is defined in the
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/ignition/tree/spec2x">Ignition config spec</a>.
Files of the same format are used later by the MCO to merge changes into a
machine’s configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contents: Because the bootstrap machine serves the Ignition configs for other
machines, both master and worker machine Ignition config information is stored in the
<code>bootstrap.ign</code>, along with the bootstrap machine’s configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size: The file is more than 1300 lines long, with path to various types of resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The content of each file that will be copied to the machine is actually encoded
into data URLs, which tends to make the content a bit clumsy to read. (Use the
  jq and base64 commands shown previously to make the content more readable.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration: The different sections of the Ignition config file are generally
meant to contain files that are just dropped into a machine’s file system, rather
than commands to modify existing files. For example, instead of having a section
on NFS that configures that service, you would just add an NFS configuration
file, which would then be started by the init process when the system comes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>users: A user named core is created, with your ssh key assigned to that user.
This allows you to log in to the cluster with that user name and your
credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>storage: The storage section identifies files that are added to each machine. A
few notable files include <code>/root/.docker/config.json</code> (which provides credentials
  your cluster needs to pull from container image registries) and a bunch of
  manifest files in <code>/opt/openshift/manifests</code> that are used to configure your cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systemd: The systemd section holds content used to create systemd unit files.
Those files are used to start up services at boot time, as well as manage those
services on running systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primitives: Ignition also exposes low-level primitives that other tools can
build on.</p>

<p>The Machine Config Operator acts somewhat differently than Ignition when it
comes to applying these machineconfigs. The machineconfigs are read in order
(from 00* to 99*). Labels inside the machineconfigs identify the type of node
each is for (master or worker). If the same file appears in multiple
machineconfig files, the last one wins. So, for example, any file that appears
in a 99* file would replace the same file that appeared in a 00* file.
The input machineconfig objects are unioned into a "rendered" machineconfig
object, which will be used as a target by the operator and is the value you
can see in the machineconfigpool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see what files are being managed from a machineconfig, look for “Path:”
inside a particular machineconfig. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="nowrap">$ oc describe machineconfigs 01-worker-container-runtime | grep Path:
            Path:            /etc/containers/registries.conf
            Path:            /etc/containers/storage.conf
            Path:            /etc/crio/crio.conf</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you wanted to change a setting in one of those files, for example to
change pids_limit to 1500 (pids_limit = 1500) inside the <code>crio.conf</code> file, you
could create a new machineconfig containing only the file you want to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be sure to give the machineconfig a later name
(such as 10-worker-container-runtime). Keep in mind that the content of each
file is in URL-style data. Then apply the new machineconfig to the cluster.</p>
